rebrow - Python-Flask-based Browser for Redis Content
=====================================================

Built for the developer who needs to look into a Redis store.
Allows for inspection and deletion of keys and follows PubSub messages. Also displays
some runtime and configuration information.

## Features

* Web based
* Runs in Python 2.7
* Lightweight requirements
* Search for keys using patterns
* Delete single keys
* Show PubSub messages
* Show server statistics

## Quick Start

Execute this:

    git clone https://github.com/marians/rebrow.git
    cd rebrow
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python runserver.py

Then open [127.0.0.1:5001](http://127.0.0.1:5001).

## Running as Docker container

If you run redis in a Docker container, the recommended way is to run rebrow in it's own Docker container, too.

You can use the ready-made public image [marian/rebrow](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/marian/rebrow/).

Alternatively, the provided `Dockerfile` can be used to create the according image. The `Makefile` contains example commands to build the image and run a container from the image.

When running the image, make sure to get your links right. For example, if your redis server is running in a container named `myredis`, start your rebrow container like this:

```
docker run --rm -ti -p 5001:5001 --link myredis:myredis marian/rebrow
```
Or, if you are using docker-compose:

```
...
myredis:
  image: redis
  hostname: myredis
  ports:
    - "6379:6379"
gui:
  image: marian/rebrow
  links:
    - "myredis:myredis"
  ports:
    - "5001:5001"
...
```

Then access rebrow via `http://<your-docker-ip>:5001/` and set the host name in the login screen to `myredis`.
